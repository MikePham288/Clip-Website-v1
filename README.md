# Clips.Personal.Project

This is the version 1 of this project, where I was mostly learning and applying basic knowledge from tutorials. This project uses Angular (13.3.5), WebAssembly, Videojs, Tailwind CSS and Firebase for backend.

## Functionality

This is a video website that have some functions like:

- Watch clips (your clip or someone else's clip)
- Create account to use the following functions
- Manage your clips
- Upload your clips
- Generate 3 thumbnails that was picked from your clip (generated from first, second, and third second of the clip respectively using WebAssembly)
- Copy your clip's URL in manage page by a click of a button.

## Further improvements in future

This project was me mostly learning from tutorials, so I would want to redesign/ remake this project to improve some of the following points:

- I would want to use custom css as much as possible instead of using Tailwind CSS.
- Design and develop its own back-end application instead of using FIrebase (probably in C# .Net 6 or MongoDB)e
- some more touchups on the projects, like filtering the playing clips from the recommending clips list, more customized design/theme
- Last but not least, the most important part is to do clean up codes on some of the files: separate functions, etc
